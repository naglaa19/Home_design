                    <p class="p4">Augmented reality (AR) is a modern technology trend combining computer-generated input with a real-world environment. Without a doubt, AR is implemented widely in interior design and is considered a highly sought-after trend for beginners, amateurs, and professionals. The key secret of its success lies in the simple fact that designers don’t have to figure out how AR technology works — with the help of advanced tools that support it, a house model can be easily viewed in AR minutes after the interior design is ready.</p>

            <br> AR tracking is performed thanks to the Vuforia SDK, which can be easily integrated in Unity.
